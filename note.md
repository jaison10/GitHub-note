## Hello ! :sparkles: Here we learn how to use Git for GitHub.:fire:

- Download GitBash and login with your GitHub account. Click [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download Gitbash. 
- Go to the repository where you want to work on and contribute your best. 
- Fork the repository which will create a copy of that repository in your profile. 
- Click on ``` Clone or download ``` and copy the URL shown there. 
- Goto Gitbash and run ```npm install```. 
- Clone that repository into your Computer through the command ```git clone <URL>```.
<br>  For example: ```git clone jaison10/GitHub-note```. 
- Run ```git init``` which creates a .git file in that repository.
- Run ```git branch <branchname>``` to create new branch.
- Run ```git checkout <branchname> ``` to jump into newly created branch. 
- Then go to the folder and make the changes you are willing to.
- After all the editing, come back to ```master``` branch through ```git checkout master```. 
- Run ```git merge branch_name master```.
- Running ```git status``` finds the changes you did.
- Then commit the changes by running ```commit -m "mention the changes"```. 
- Running ```git log``` lists down all the commits you did.
- Push the changes you did through running ```git push -u origin master```.
<br>
<br>
If you want to push from other branch, run ```git push -u origin <branchname>```.


## THANK YOU !
